/**
 * @file SPF_GameConsole_API.h
 * @brief API for programmatically executing commands in the in-game developer console.
 *
 * @details This API provides a bridge between your plugin and the game engine's
 * built-in command processor. It allows you to run any command that a user could
 * manually type into the developer console (e.g., 'g_traffic', 'g_set_time').
 *
 * This is a one-way interface designed for automation and integration of existing
 * game features into your plugin's UI or logic.
 *
 * ================================================================================================
 * KEY CONCEPTS
 * ================================================================================================
 *
 * 1. **Mandatory Hook**: To use this API, your plugin MUST declare a dependency on the
 *    'GameConsole' hook in its manifest using 'api->Policy_AddRequiredHook(handle, "GameConsole")'.
 *
 * 2. **One-Way Execution**: This API only sends commands to the game. It does not
 *    receive feedback or return values from the console.
 *
 * 3. **No Command Registration**: This API is for execution only. It cannot be used to
 *    register new, custom console commands.
 *
 * ================================================================================================
 * USAGE EXAMPLE (C++)
 * ================================================================================================
 * @code
 * // In response to a UI button click:
 * if (ui->Button("Fast Forward Time", 0, 0)) {
 *     // Skip to afternoon
 *     api->GCon_ExecuteCommand("g_set_time 14 00");
 * }
 * @endcode
