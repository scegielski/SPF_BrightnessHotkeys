/**
 * @file SPF_Localization_API.h
 * @brief API for providing multi-language support to plugins.
 *
 * @details This API enables plugins to load translation files (JSON) and retrieve
 * localized strings at runtime. It supports dynamic language switching and
 * automatic fallback to a default language (usually English).
 *
 * ================================================================================================
 * KEY CONCEPTS
 * ================================================================================================
 *
 * 1. **Context-Based**: Every call requires a 'SPF_Localization_Handle'. Get it
 *    once during 'OnActivated' using 'Loc_GetContext()'.
 *
 * 2. **Dot Notation**: Translation keys use dot-notation to traverse nested JSON
 *    objects (e.g., 'menu.buttons.quit').
 *
 * 3. **Fallback System**: If a key is missing in the active language, the system
 *    automatically attempts to find it in the plugin's default language.
 *
 * ================================================================================================
 * USAGE EXAMPLE (C++)
 * ================================================================================================
 * @code
 * void MyPlugin_OnActivated(const SPF_Core_API* api) {
 *     SPF_Localization_Handle* h = api->localization->Loc_GetContext("MyPlugin");
 *
 *     char buffer[256];
 *     api->localization->Loc_GetString(h, "ui.welcome_msg", buffer, sizeof(buffer));
 *     Log("Localized: %s", buffer);
 * }
 * @endcode

/**
 * @struct SPF_Localization_API
 * @brief API for the framework's localization system.
 *
 * @details This API allows a plugin to load and use translation files, enabling
 *          multilingual support for its UI and messages. The system works by
 *          associating a plugin with a set of translation files (e.g., JSON)
 *          and providing functions to retrieve strings based on a key.
 *
 * @section Workflow
 * 1.  **File Structure**: Place your translation files in a dedicated folder
 *     within your plugin's directory, typically `localization/`. For example:
 *     - `MyPlugin/localization/en.json`
 *     - `MyPlugin/localization/uk.json`
 * 2.  **Manifest**: Specify the default language in your plugin's manifest, e.g., `"en"`.
 * 3.  **Get Context**: In your `OnActivated` function, call `Loc_GetContext()` to get a
 *     handle for your plugin.
 * 4.  **Get Strings**: Use `Loc_GetString()` with the handle and a key to retrieve
 *     translated strings.
 * 5.  **Change Language**: (Optional) Use `Loc_SetLanguage()` to change the active
 *     language at runtime.
 *
 * @section LanguageDisplayNames Providing Language Display Names
 * When displaying a list of available languages in the UI (e.g., in the settings panel),
 * the framework automatically constructs translation keys for each language code.
 *
 * For a language with code `[lang_code]` (e.g., "en", "uk"), the system will look for
 * a key in the format `language.[lang_code]` (e.g., "language.en", "language.uk").
 *
 * To ensure your language names are properly translated in the UI, you must include
 * these keys in your component's localization files (e.g., `MyPlugin/localization/en.json`).
 *
 * @b Example:
 * In your `[component]/localization/en.json` file:
 * @code{.json}
 * {
 *   "language": {
 *     "en": "English",
 *     "uk": "Ukrainian",
 *     "fr": "French"
 *   }
 * }
 * @endcode
 *
 * The framework will then use these entries to display "English", "Ukrainian",
 * or "French" in the UI dropdowns, instead of just the raw language codes "en", "uk", "fr".
 * Each component (framework or plugin) is responsible for providing its own translations
 * for these language display names.
