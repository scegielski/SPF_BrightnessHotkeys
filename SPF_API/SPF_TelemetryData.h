// This file defines the C-compatible data structures for the Telemetry API.
// It is designed to be included by plugins that wish to access telemetry data.
// The layout and types are fixed to ensure ABI stability.

/**
 * @section ABI Stability Rules (For Framework Developers)
 * To maintain binary compatibility with older plugins:
 * 1. NEVER change the order of existing fields in these structures.
 * 2. NEVER remove existing fields.
 * 3. NEW FIELDS must always be added to the VERY END of the structure.
 * 4. Ensure that the framework's copy logic (TelemetryApi.cpp) uses struct_size
 *    to avoid writing beyond the plugin's allocated memory.
